# Results of algorithms
Library of files with results of algorithmic evaluations and comparisons, with the purpose of making them publicly available.

- [results_BRACIS_2019](https://github.com/luistertulino/results_algorithms/blob/master/results_BRACIS_2019.zip):
    - Paper name: ``TSchainRad: a new Tabu Search-based matheuristic for IMRT optimization``
    - Description: comparisons between two Tabu Search algorithms for IMRT optimization for the BRACIS 2019 conference paper.
    - [The BsC monograph where I developed the algorithm - in Brazilian Portuguese](https://monografias.ufrn.br/jspui/bitstream/123456789/6729/1/MatheuristicaGeometria_CunhaNeto_2018.pdf) (that later became the paper). The algorithm is in **Section 4**. The computational experiments described on Section 5 are strongly different from those on the paper, and should NOT be taken as a textual description of the numerical data contained in the above file.
